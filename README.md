# Frame-Classifier-in-pytorch
This project implements a lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) designed to classify individual video frames into three key railway-related categories: train, track, and signal. The goal is to enable efficient frame-level classification for real-time railway monitoring systems where low-latency and high-speed inference are crucial.

🧠 Key Features


Minimal Architecture: A simple yet effective CNN with two convolutional layers, pooling, and fully connected layers for fast training and inference.


Synthetic Dataset: Utilizes a simulated dataset of random image tensors to demonstrate functionality and pipeline flow. Ideal for testing model structure and training logic without heavy computational load.


Multiclass Classification: Supports classification across 3 target classes using CrossEntropyLoss.

Learning Git step by step



PyTorch Implementation: Built entirely with PyTorch, allowing easy customization and extension for real-world datasets.
