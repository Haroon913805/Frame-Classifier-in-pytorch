# Frame-Classifier-in-pytorch
This project implements a lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) designed to classify individual video frames into three key railway-related categories: train, track, and signal. The goal is to enable efficient frame-level classification for real-time railway monitoring systems where low-latency and high-speed inference are crucial.
